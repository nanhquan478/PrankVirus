> ❌ Do NOT use these scripts to deceive, scare, or harm others without their permission.

This is a collection of 3 harmless batch scripts (.bat) designed to simulate "virus" attacks on Windows. They do not delete files, install malware, or cause real damage — they are purely for fun, pranks, or scripting practice.

## 🗂 Included Scripts

### 📄 1. `prankvirus_cod.bat` – The “Free Call of Duty” Prank

Pretends to award the user with a free download of Call of Duty. After simulating a fake download, it pretends to detect a virus, delete SYSTEM32, and shows fake "hacker messages". It ends with a surprise twist — it was all a joke!

🔹 Features:
- Fake download progress with color changes
- SYSTEM32 "deletion" warning
- Fake takeover by a hacker
- Funny reveal at the end

📌 Best for: Long, dramatic pranks with a humorous payoff.

### 📄 2. `prankvirus_warning.bat` – “C:/ Drive Under Attack”

A fast-paced prank script that simulates a system alert about a virus infecting the C:/ drive. It repeats directory listings to simulate file deletions, then says “Just kidding!”

🔹 Features:
- Fake antivirus dialogue
- Repeats `dir /s` to mimic mass deletion
- Ends with “NOTHING HAS BEEN DELETED!”

📌 Best for: Quick, intense pranks that escalate quickly.

### 📄 3. `prankvirus_shutdown.bat` – Explorer Crash + Fake Virus Removal

Simulates detecting and removing a virus, then kills `explorer.exe` to make it look like the desktop is broken. Ends with a real 5-second shutdown timer and a fake "Windows infected" warning.

🔹 Features:
- Explorer crashes and restarts
- Fake virus alerts and failure messages
- Ends with `shutdown -s -t 5` (can be canceled)

💡 To cancel shutdown: Open CMD quickly and type `shutdown -a`.

📌 Best for: Short, punchy pranks that end with a system shutdown scare.
